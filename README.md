[`hopten`](https://github.com/nikitn2/PolyTensorNetworks) is a python package for performing High-Order Polynomial regression with TENsor networks ([`quimb`](https://github.com/jcmgray/quimb) provides the tensor networks backend) as part of a University of Copenhagen – Technical University of Denmark collaboration 

Both regression and classification is envisioned, although the classification functionality is unfinished. It is straightforward to load any dataset in, with current support for pulling “Year Prediction MSD”, “House(16H)”, “Wine Quality” and “CASP” datasets from OpenML or the UC Irvine ML Repositories.

Warning: this is an experimental research code in an unfinished state.
